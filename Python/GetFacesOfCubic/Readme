In this python code I tried to implement gui to get faces of Rubik''s cubic from the user 
- Faces are taken in a dictionary where every key represent the center of the face and its values are colors of this face
-this dictionary will be taken and pass to kassombia algorithms which will solve it.
This is part of AI project
